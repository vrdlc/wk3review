##Description
The third week of school began to put into practice what we had learned in the previous week. We focused on looping, specifically "for" loops, and dedicated full days to completing single projects that would, for example, translate English into Pig Latin. 

This project counts up to a number the user chooses, but replaces every number divsible by three with "ping", every number divisible by five with "pong", and every number divisible by fifteen with "pingpong". 
##Setup
######Open the index.html file in your browser bar and proceed from there. Currently that is the only way it can be viewed, but when I have it up and running you'll be able to reach it via vrdlc.github.io, my temporary portfolio site.
